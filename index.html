                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
                text.
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
                BC,
                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                professor
                at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                and
                going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                discovered the undoubtable source
